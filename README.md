## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate HelpScout into your Xcode project using Carthage, add this to your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "koombea/HelpScout" ~> 4.5
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `HelpScout.framework` into your Xcode project.
